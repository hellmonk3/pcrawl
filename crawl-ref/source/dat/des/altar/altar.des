# altar.des: This contains most of the generic altar vaults.
#            All vaults in this file focus on the altar, in particular, all
#            maps are rather small.
#            Some maps containing altars should *not* go in this file.
#            These are
#            * Vaults placing in D with Temple god altars.
#              These should be overflow vaults instead, to give the dungeon
#              builder control over early altar placement.
#            * Ecumenical altar vaults for D:1-3.
#              Use ecumenical.des
#            * Branch-specific vaults
#              (Beogh altar minivaults for Armory, for example)
#              These go into the corresponding des-file of the branch.
#            * Entry vaults with altars
#              Don't make these, they encourage startscumming.
#            * Overflow altars.
#              (I.e. altars dedicated to Temple gods which can be used if the
#              gods do not show up in the Temple).
#              Use overflow.des.
#            * Large non-overflow vaults.
#              These are vaults where the altar is used for thematic reasons.
#              Use a file in the variable/ directory.
#
#            For a particularly elaborate altar map, using lots of lua, use a
#            single, new file.
