Cuts the health of a target creature in half. This damage is never directly
lethal.

Causes the air around a creature to twist itself into a whirling vortex of
meteorological fury. It does more damage to targets surrounded by empty space.
%%%%
Alistair's Intoxication spell

Converts a small portion of the brain matter of those around you into alcohol,
attempting to confuse all intelligent creatures within view (although
poison-resistant creatures may resist the effects). The caster will experience
vertigo briefly if they successfully make contact with other minds. It is
frequently used as an icebreaker at wizard parties.
%%%%
Alistair's Dodgeable Bolt spell

A wizard's party trick, this spell conjures a trick bolt of lightning that is
laughably easy to avoid. Any target capable of evading it is guaranteed to do
so.

Not recommended for use on clumsy, sleeping, or otherwise incapacitated
targets, as the bolt is quite painful if it manages to connect.
%%%%
Anguish spell

Afflicts nearby foes with supernatural anguish, causing them to receive damage
equal to the damage they deal for a duration. Strong-willed foes can resist the
necromantic visions of pain and suffering, and mindless creatures are unaffected.
%%%%
Animate Armour spell

Call upon the spirit of your worn armour to fight alongside you. The spirit moves
slowly, but draws strength from the inherent protection of your own armour. At
higher power, the spirit becomes more durable.
%%%%
Animate Dead spell

For some time after casting this, living creatures killed by the caster will rise
as zombies. The chance of reanimating a monster and the duration of the effect
increase with spell power. Re-casting this spell will return any existing 
zombies to dust. More durable monsters will make more durable zombies, though 
all creatures reanimated by this spell are quite frail.
%%%%
Apportation spell

Pulls the top item or group of similar items from a distant pile to the floor
near the caster. With low power, items might not be moved all the way to the
caster's position.

Extremely powerful magical items, such as the Orb of Zot, may actively resist
the pull of this spell.
%%%%
Arcjolt spell

Sends a wave of electricity through everything adjacent or near-adjacent to
the caster. The electricity continues to arc through everything in a connected
chain, though the caster themself is unaffected. The damage dealt bypasses half
of defenders' armour.
%%%%
Aura of Brilliance spell

Empowers the magic of nearby wizard allies of the caster, allowing them to
cast their magic more powerfully and more often.

Avatar Song spell

Sings a powerfully haunting song; in addition to making nearby victims
unwilling to move away from the singer, it calls forth drowned souls from
any nearby bodies of deep water.
%%%%
Awaken Forest spell

Gives some limited motility to nearby trees, allowing them to sway their
branches and shift their roots. Such enchanted trees will lash at any adjacent
enemy.

the bolt's destination.

resistance.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification spell

Instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also permanently
lowers their maximum health. Spellpower reduces the amount of maximum health 
lost, but never fully prevents it.

It is powerful enough to cancel the effects of Death's Door, although doing so
will briefly paralyse the caster. It has no effect on the undead.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Vile Clutch spell

Calls forth hands from corpses interred beneath the dungeon floor long ago.
Enemies caught in the area will be held in place and constricted until they
break free.

with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%

that is thrice reduced by armour.

The boulder will disintegrate if it leaves the caster's sight.
%%%%

<Brothers in Arms ability>
%%%%
Call Canine Familiar spell

Summons a solitary canine to the caster's aid. Spell power increases the chance
of summoning a stronger breed.
%%%%
Call Down Damnation spell

Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation, with no direct line of fire required.
These unholy forces harm the victim and anyone adjacent, and are not affected
by any means of protection, such as armour or resistances. However, certain
creatures, usually those able to invoke damnation themselves, are entirely
unscathed by damnation.
%%%%
Call Down Lightning spell

Blasts a targeted enemy with lightning, with no direct line of fire required.
The targeting magics need distance to function, so enemies that are adjacent
or nearly adjacent cannot be struck by this.
%%%%
Call Imp spell

Calls forth a minor demon from the pits of Hell, equipped with a spear with
which to jab at the caster's enemies. The quality of the imp's weaponry rises
with spell power.
%%%%

Summons a necromantic spectre. These lost souls can enter the bodies of more
powerful undead to bring them back from brink of demise, or turn dying living
creatures into spectral versions of themselves.
%%%%
Call of Chaos spell

Calls upon the powers of chaos to empower nearby allies, granting them haste,
might, agility, or improved resistances. The chaotic magic may occasionally
backfire and cause allies to instead lose their willpower or be berserked,
polymorphed, or filled with inner flame.
%%%%
Call Tide spell

Allows the caster to affect the tidal phase of all water within a large
distance. Soon after calling it, the waters on the whole level will reach high
tide. Waters near the caster will reach even higher levels than they would
normally.
%%%%
Cantrip spell

Casts one of a number of minor spells, aimed at trying to bolster the caster's
morale. They have no noticeable effect.
%%%%

approach the caster, and to sometimes fail to attack them in melee. Leaving the
caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Chain of Chaos spell

Creates an arc of pure chaos, striking nearby creatures with unpredictable
effects. The arc can touch upon the caster without harming them.
%%%%
Chain Lightning spell

Releases a massive electrical discharge that arcs to the creature nearest the
caster and then outward from it. The further it travels, the less damage it
does. Secondary arcs have limited range and do little damage to the caster.
The spell bypasses half of defenders' armour and resistance to electricity.
%%%%
Charm spell

Causes an otherwise hostile creature to fight on the caster's side for a while.
%%%%
Chaos Breath spell

Exhales a large cloud of fumes filled with the very essence of chaos.
%%%%
Chilling Breath spell

Exhales a blast of frost which may knock the target back if it deals damage.
%%%%
Cigotuvi's Creeping Rot spell

Transforms every cloud in the caster's sight into a cloud of miasma. The miasma
slows and heavily damages living and demonic creatures that linger within it,
but undead creatures or artifical constructs are immune. Most susceptible
creatures are terrified of miasma and will not willingly enter it.
%%%%
Cleansing Flame spell

<Cleansing Flame ability>
%%%%
Cold Breath spell

Exhales a focused blast of icy-cold air.
%%%%
Concentrate Venom spell

Intensifies the natural venom of the target monster. Poisonous bites and spit
become intense enough to slow and asphyxiate.
%%%%
Condensation Shield spell

Causes a disc of dense vapour to condense out of the air surrounding the
caster. It blocks attacks like a normal shield, but its effectiveness depends
solely on power, and not on the Shields skill. The disc is controlled by the
caster's mind, and thus will not conflict with the wielding of a two-handed
weapon.
%%%%
Confuse spell

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind.
%%%%
Confusing Touch spell

Enchants the caster's dominant hand with magical energy. This energy is
released when the caster touches a monster, and may induce a state of confusion
in the monster. The caster's attacks do no damage while attempting to touch a
monster in this way.
%%%%
Confusion Gaze spell

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind, with no
direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning spell

Creates a pack of ball lightnings, which seek out the nearest enemy before
exploding in a huge blast of electricity. The damage dealt bypasses half of
defenders' armour. Casters are advised to use extreme caution; the lightning is
not mindful of what it may hit.

The magic which keeps ball lightnings cohesive has limited range, so they may
dissipate harmlessly if allowed to drift out of their caster's sight before
exploding.
%%%%
Conjure Living Spells spell

Creates several living, autonomous spells, which cast themselves at the first foe
to enter their range. Once cast, they dissipate.
%%%%
Corona spell

Causes a halo of glowing light to surround and effectively outline a creature.
This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and makes the
affected creature appreciably easier to hit.
%%%%
Corrosive Bolt spell

Fires a penetrating bolt of acid.
%%%%
Corrupt spell

Unleashes Abyssal energies in the immediate vicinity. This changes the
appearance of the affected area and temporarily summons creatures from the
Abyss. This cannot be used in the Abyss itself.
%%%%
Corrupting Pulse spell

Instills a corruption within all visible targets, temporarily mutating their
bodies in an adverse fashion. It cannot affect artificial beings, and the
undead will decompose if affected.
%%%%
Creeping Frost spell

Calls forth freezing cold from the walls. Any enemies of the caster standing
next to the walls will be frozen and will find their movements slowed. Cold
resistance will reduce damage, but not prevent the freezing effect.
%%%%
Crystal Bolt spell

Projects a penetrating projectile with peculiar magical properties. It is
randomly imbued with either fire or ice, and additionally will reflect from
walls of any material due to the crystal embedded in the shot.
%%%%
Dazzling Flash spell

The caster erupts in a scintillating display of light. Any living creature
nearby may be dazzled and left stumbling blindly.
%%%%
Death Channel spell

Binds the souls of slain living and demonic creatures, forcing their
spectres to remain and fight for the caster for as long as the channel lasts.
The spectres are less durable than the original monsters, but deal comparable
damage. Casting the spell again while it is active will extend its duration.
%%%%
Death Rattle spell

Exhales the essence of the dying, creating clouds of noxious miasma.
%%%%
Death's Door spell

Renders the caster nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but brings
them dangerously close to death in the process. So close, in fact, that the
body believes itself to be dead — healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. After
expiry, the spell cannot immediately be recast, but with high power the caster
will be left further from death when the effect ends. It has no effect on those
who are already undead.
%%%%
Debugging Ray spell

Fires a ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Deflect Missiles spell

Guarantees that ranged attacks will miss the caster for a brief duration.
The spell has no effect on attacks that cannot normally be dodged, such as
explosions.
%%%%
Dig spell

Digs a tunnel through unworked rock.
%%%%
Dimension Anchor spell

Blocks any translocations attempted by the affected target, be they voluntary
or not. This includes even some cross-plane effects, although notably not
Banishment.
%%%%
Dimensional Bullseye spell

Weaves a link between the caster's weaponry and a chosen target. Whenever the
caster fires or throws something at a *different* enemy, a matching projectile
will be teleported at the target. Spellpower increases their accuracy.

Every shot will drain a drop of magic while the link persists.
%%%%
Discord spell

Drives nearby creatures into an wild frenzy, causing them to mercilessly
attack anything and everything nearby with great strength and speed.
%%%%
Disjunction spell

Destabilizes the space in a sphere around the caster for a while, causing
anyone nearby to blink away from the caster. The chance of blinking depends on
the distance from the caster, being nearly certain when directly adjacent.
%%%%
Dispel Undead spell

Harms an adjacent undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces
binding it together.
%%%%
Dispel Undead Range spell

Harms an undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces binding it
together.
%%%%
Dispersal spell

Teleports away any creatures within a short distance of the caster. Any
creature with the Will to resist will still be irresistibly blinked a shorter
distance, and any monster it affects at all has a separate Will-based chance
of being confused by the warping of space.
%%%%
Doom Howl spell

Unleashes a piercing howl that catches and echoes in victims' minds. While
those echoes linger, nightmarish creatures will hear and track them to their
source. It can only be used once by a given creature.
%%%%
Dragon's Call spell

Issues a powerful call to a draconic realm, beckoning forth dragon after dragon
to engage the summoner's enemies. The spell is taxing to maintain, and each new
dragon which answers the call will cost an additional 1 mp. After the call ends, 
it cannot be issued again for a short time. The duration of the call depends on 
spell power.
%%%%
Drain Life spell

Drains the life force of any nearby creatures, healing the user depending on
the damage dealt.
%%%%
Drain Magic spell

Causes the target's magic to leak into the air, as though they were hit by an
antimagic weapon.
%%%%

Causes the target's magic to leak into the air, as though they were hit by an
antimagic weapon, and heals the caster for the amount of magic drained,
with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Dream Dust spell

Overwhelms the target with soporific dream dust, putting them to sleep with an
enchanting visual display. Additional dream sheep will increase the strength
and duration of this effect.
%%%%
Druid's Call spell

Recalls woodland creatures from elsewhere on the same level.
%%%%
Electrical Bolt spell

Throws a bolt of electricity at the target, with high accuracy.
%%%%
Energy Bolt spell

Fires a bolt of highly destructive energy.

attacks and disrupting their magic. It will additionally daze and blind any foe
that fails to resist the full force of the curse.
%%%%
Ensnare spell

Shoots a stream of webbing at a creature, ensnaring the target in a sticky web.
%%%%
Ensorcelled Hibernation spell

Lowers its target's metabolic rate, putting it to sleep. Creatures put to sleep
by this spell always have the lowest possible chance to awaken. Undead and
nonliving creatures are totally immune to sleep, and cold-resistant monsters
are also unaffected by this spell.
%%%%
Entropic Weave spell

Corrodes the target, with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Eringya's Noxious Bog spell

Causes the caster to release a torrent of sludge that transforms nearby areas
into a toxic bog. The sludge damages and poisons all monsters, even those
resistant to poison. The bog cannot form on areas adjacent to multiple solid
features, nor on areas that lack solid floor, like deep water or lava. The
transformation is temporary and cannot be sustained out of the caster's sight.
Spellpower will increase how long the bog lingers.
%%%%
Eruption spell

Splits the earth to draw up a localized, short-lived volcano under the target.
%%%%
Flay spell

Opens painful illusionary wounds on the target's body, which disappear after
a short time or on the death of the caster. This cannot kill directly, and is
ineffective against unnatural targets.
%%%%
Fire Breath spell

Breathes a blast of fire at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Fire Storm spell

damage in a large area and leaving behind short-lived fire vortices. Half of

%%%%
Fireball spell

It's every wizard's favorite spell. Like all explosions, it is quite loud but
impossible to dodge.

Flame Lance spell

Imbues the caster's body with intense flames. When moving, the caster will
launch a penetrating bolt of fire in the direction of the movement.
%%%%
Flame Wave spell

Blasts the caster's surroundings with a wave of fire. If the caster maintains
focus and supplies the spell with magical power (by waiting in place and not
taking any other actions), larger flame waves will radiate outward.
%%%%
Flaming Cloud spell

Conjures up a large cloud of roaring flames.
%%%%
Flash Freeze spell

Freezes the air around a target, causing significant harm and slowing the
target's movement. Half of its damage bypasses cold resistance. It has no
effect on targets that are already frozen.
%%%%
Force Lance spell

Fires a shaft of concussive force. If the impact deals damage, it may knock the
target back.
%%%%
Force Quake spell

Suffuses translocational energy into the ground at the caster's feet, producing
a localized earthquake that damages adjacent creatures, moves with the caster,
and lasts for three actions. The final aftershock releases the translocational
energy and may knock back anything it hits.
%%%%
Forceful Invitation spell

Summons some creatures from one of the Snake Pit, the Spider Nest, the Swamp,
the Shoals, the Elven Halls, the Vaults, or the Crypt; the specific branch
varies with the caster.
%%%%
Foxfire spell

Conjures balls of burning swamp gas adjacent to the caster. The balls will
rapidly seek the nearest monster and burn them. They will dissipate harmlessly
if unable to reach a target or if the caster swaps places with them. The number
of balls created increases with spellpower.

Freezes an adjacent creature, dealing damage that bypasses armour. This may
temporarily slow cold-blooded creatures.

Freezing Cloud spell

Conjures up a large cloud of lethally cold vapour.
%%%%
Frigid Halo spell

Freezes all hostile creatures adjacent to the caster, dealing cold damage that
bypasses armour.
%%%%
Frozen Ramparts spell

Encases surrounding walls with ice for a short time. Foes that wander near the
icy walls will be damaged, and this may temporarily slow cold-blooded creatures.
Each victim is only ever affected by one icy wall at a time.

The ice will crack and fall away if the caster moves to a new position.
%%%%
Fulminant Prism spell

Conjures a prism which unleashes a violent explosion of arcane force after a
short duration. The prism is extremely fragile and any damage caused to it may
result in premature detonation.
%%%%
Funeral Dirge spell

A ritual chant that briefly rouses several nearby undead allies to move more
swiftly and strike with greater might.
%%%%
Gell's Gravitas spell

Briefly redirects gravity around a target point, causing 'down' to be towards

point – typically colliding with each other, or with a victim standing there.
%%%%
Ghostly Fireball spell

Hurls an exploding ball of negative energy which drains any living creature
it engulfs.
%%%%
Ghostly Legion spell

Summons a legion of phantasmal warriors, each attacking a different one of the 
caster's foes. The number of ghosts summoned depends on the number of foes
visible, limited by the caster's power. The ghosts disappear quickly once their 
target is killed.
%%%%
Ghostly Sacrifice spell

Uses an ally's motivating essence to create a blast of negative energy,
draining any living creature it engulfs. The being used to fuel the spell, no
matter whether living or construct, is consumed and unmade in the process.
%%%%
Throw Ally spell

Throws a nearby ally at the monster's foe, doing minimal damage and landing the
thrown monster nearby.
%%%%
Glaciate spell

Conjures forth a mighty blast of ice. Creatures within its cone-shaped area of
effect take damage, with higher damage being dealt to those close to the
caster. Those hit by the blast are encased in ice, slowing their movement, and
those killed by the blast may be frozen into solid blocks of ice. Half of its
damage bypasses cold resistance.
%%%%
Grasping Roots spell

Calls giant grasping roots from deep underground that hold and constrict their
victim. The roots will retreat if the victim breaks free or if the caller moves
out of view.
%%%%
Greater Servant of Makhleb spell

Summons a major demon.
%%%%
Hailstorm spell

Conjures a cannonade of hail, battering nearby creatures that fail to dodge.
The eye of the storm is wide enough that monsters adjacent to the caster are
unaffected. Due to the strong impact and cutting edges, half of its damage
bypasses cold resistance. The damage scales strongly with spellpower.
%%%%
Haste Other spell

Speeds the actions of a nearby ally.
%%%%
Harpoon Shot spell

Fires a long and flexible barbed mass. The ensnared victim will either be
pulled adjacent to the caster or collide with anything blocking the way.

gods. These flames are especially dangerous to undead and demonic creatures,

Holy Flames spell

Traps an enemy in a ring of blessed flame. These flames are especially
dangerous to undead and demonic creatures, and have no effect on holy
creatures.
%%%%
Iceblast spell

Fires a large mass of ice, which explodes on impact. It affects even
cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due to the strong impact and cutting edges.
%%%%
Ice Statue spell

Summons a fragile statue made of ice. Though lacking in defenses and unable to
attack itself, the statue can summon large numbers of ice beasts.
%%%%
Ignite Poison spell

Converts all nearby poison into liquid flame, burning poisoned creatures from
within. It also turns clouds of poison and mephitic gases into flame. The
caster is not affected directly.
%%%%
Ignition spell

All foes in the caster's surroundings are engulfed in balls of fire. The caster
and their allies are protected from the fire and will never be harmed by this
spell.

%%%%
Infestation spell

Calls forth a plague of scarabs to coat the caster's hands or melee weapon. As 
long  as the spell lasts, any monster hit by the caster will become infested.
When an infested monster dies, a death scarab will burst forth from their 
remains, though this renders the corpse unusable for the purposes of other
necromantic spells in the process.
%%%%
Injury Bond spell

Binds the caster to nearby allies, redirecting half of any damage they suffer
to the caster.
%%%%
Injury Mirror spell

Reflects damage taken for a short duration, hurting attackers whenever any
damage is taken.

%%%%
Iron Shot spell

Hurls a large and heavy metal shot.
%%%%
Irradiate spell

Transmutes an ultra-thin layer of the caster's skin (or equivalent) directly
into pure magical energy, blasting adjacent creatures. It may heavily deform
its victims, weakening them and reducing their armour. The caster is not left
entirely unaffected; some of the magic lingers, enough to leave them
dangerously contaminated after a few castings.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Battlesphere spell

Conjures a small globe of magical energy. Each time its creator casts a
destructive spell (other than Battlesphere itself or Spellforged Servitor), the
battlesphere will launch its own volley of energy at a random foe. With
increasing power, the battlesphere lasts longer and deals more damage per
volley.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast spell

Detonates a crackling sphere of destructive energy. The explosion will hit all
nearby monsters with physical force, knocking them back if damage is done.
%%%%
Jinxbite spell

Calls the attention of trickster spirits. While it holds, the spirits will
follow up on the caster's attacks. If the spell overcomes victims' willpower,
they will suffer minor damage and be drained by the sprites' playful malice.

Fae assistance is fickle, however; they cannot be beckoned unless a susceptible
victim is visible, and will depart rapidly once no more remain. Calling on the
fae also reduces the caster's own willpower for a time.
%%%%
Volatile Blastmotes spell

Brings forth a cloud of volatile blastmotes beneath the caster, which explode
when something moves into them or when they're exposed to open flames. The
explosion knocks adjacent creatures away and stuns them. Damage dealt increases
with the spell's power.
%%%%
Leda's Liquefaction spell

Liquefies the ground around the caster, making it difficult to move through.
Any movement through liquefied ground will be slowed, and creatures stuck in
the liquefied ground will be unable to fly. Attempts to attack the caster
in melee may fail.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out. Maintaining the
connection to the ground slows the caster's movement, even if they are flying.
%%%%
Leda's Unmaking spell

Fires a blast of high-speed entropy. Slain victims dissolve into mud, slowing
the movements and impairing the attacks of creatures stuck within.
%%%%
Lee's Rapid Deconstruction spell

Fragments a wall or a suitably brittle visible monster into an explosion of
deadly shrapnel. It can be used on monsters made of ice, bone, or any wall-like
substance, as well as those turned to stone by petrification. Its damage is
strongly reduced by armour.

Targets made from rock, stone, ice or bone will cause a small explosion. Metal
targets will cause a small but more damaging explosion, and targets made from
crystal will cause a large and more damaging explosion.
%%%%
Legendary Destruction spell

Conjures two explosive magical effects in instant succession. The effects can
be any mix of Fireball, Iceblast, and Ghostly Fireball.
%%%%
Lehudib's Crystal Spear spell

Hurls a lethally sharp shard of crystal.
%%%%
Lesser Beckoning spell

Beckons the target forward, attempting to place them adjacent to the caster.

armour, and it can be bounced off walls to hit targets twice.
%%%%
Magic Dart spell

Fires a small bolt of magical energy which never misses.
%%%%

Releases a powerful jet of magma from deep within the earth. Half of its damage
bypasses fire resistance. Any unoccupied space in the beam's path will be
covered in lava for a short duration.
%%%%
Major Destruction spell

Shoots a random harmful beam or explosion at the targeted creature.
%%%%
Major Healing spell

Heals a large amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Malign Gateway spell

Tears a gash in reality, creating a self-sustained but temporary portal to an
unknown, tainted otherworld. It requires open space to succeed. After a short
time, a powerful clawed tentacle will reach through the portal, remaining bound
to the caster's will for a duration depending on power. With the portal's
expiry, the tentacle will be severed and turn on the caster. The duration of
the portal increases with spell power.
%%%%
Malign Offering spell

Drains life from an enemy, healing nearby allies in the process.
%%%%
Malmutate spell

Bestows a mutation on a target. The mutation is almost always harmful. It
cannot affect artificial beings, and the undead will decompose if affected.
%%%%
Manifold Assault spell

Warps space into paradoxical configurations to strike many visible foes with
one melee attack. Power increases the number of foes attacked with one cast,
but very high power is required to launch multiple unarmed attacks in this
fashion, since great care must be taken when warping one's own limbs.

The time taken for the attack is exactly the same as a normal melee attack.
It's imprecise, so it can't do extra damage against unsuspecting foes.
%%%%
Mara Summon spell

Weaves illusions of the caster. Such illusions have the same physical prowess
as the original, and can cast the same spells.
%%%%
Marshlight spell

Conjures two balls of burning swamp gas adjacent to the caster. The balls will

with the spell 'Foxfire', but their version is much less powerful.
%%%%
Mass Confusion spell

Causes confusion in all who gaze upon the caster.
%%%%
Mass Repulsion spell

Causes all of the caster's nearby allies to begin repelling missiles.
%%%%
Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling spell

Gradually builds up electric charge in the caster, so long as they maintain
focus (by waiting in place and not taking any other actions). When a threshold
is reached, the charge couples with the nearest foe, vaporising them instantly
and irresistibly. Higher spell power will allow the caster to accumulate charge
more rapidly.
%%%%
Mephitic Cloud spell

Conjures up a short-lived cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion in
any living creature. Tougher, more experienced creatures are less likely to be
affected.
%%%%

Makes a targeted creature unwilling to move away from the caster. Leaving the
caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Metabolic Englaciation spell

Lowers the metabolic rate of every hostile creature in the caster's line of
sight, slowing them. The duration of the effect is reduced by the creature's
difficulty and their resistance to cold, but is always at least one turn.
%%%%
Metal Splinters spell

Fires a directed stream of sharp metal splinters. Its damage is reduced thrice
by armour.
%%%%
Miasma Breath spell

Creates a large cloud of foul pestilence, poisoning and sometimes slowing any
living creatures it touches.
%%%%

Significantly increases a nearby ally's damage dealt in melee.
%%%%

Significantly increases the caster's damage in melee.
%%%%
Mindburst spell

Launches a psychic attack. If it overcomes the victim's willpower, it
'blows their mind' in a violently literal fashion, dealing damage that
bypasses their armour entirely. It is useless against mindless creatures.
%%%%
Minor Healing spell

Heals a small amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Monstrous Menagerie spell

Summons a powerful exotic creature to the caster's aid: a manticore, a lindwurm,
or, at high power, even a sphinx. Casting the spell at higher power also
increases the strength of the beasts themselves.
%%%%

dying immediately afterward) may rise as skeletons to fight for the caster. Only
the living can be affected.
%%%%

%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance spell

Causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting poison on
everything in line of sight for as long as the spell lasts.
%%%%
Orb of Destruction spell

Conjures a very big rock made of destructive magic. Compared to most other
projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home onto
their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile opponents
may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to stabilize, and will
deal reduced damage based on the distance traveled until it has moved at least
four tiles. The orb will dissipate if it leaves your line of sight.
%%%%
Orb of Electricity spell

Hurls a crackling orb of electrical energy, creating a huge explosion on
impact. Its damage bypasses half of defenders' armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour spell

Envelops the caster's body in a protective layer of thick ice, granting a
substantial bonus to armour as long as they remain in their current location.
The ice will crack and fall away if the caster moves to a new position. The
duration of the effect will decrease if the caster is harmed by fire damage.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration spell

Turns the air bitterly cold, freezing all other creatures in line of sight.
This is less effective against creatures packed tightly together - those
adjacent to others will be partly insulated from the cold, taking less damage.
%%%%
Pain spell

Inflicts an extremely painful injury upon one living creature.
%%%%
Paralyse spell

Prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time.
%%%%
Paralysis Gaze spell

requiring multiple charges but not line of fire.
%%%%
Passage of Golubria spell

Opens two gateways (one always near the caster), which allow instantaneous
transport to random other open gateways to any creature entering them. There is
no limit to the number of gateways that can be open at one time. However,
gateways close a short time after being opened, or immediately once entered.
%%%%
Passwall spell

Tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through solid rock, up
to three tiles of distance. It takes some time for the caster to attune to the
rock, increasing with the distance traveled, during which they will be helpless.
%%%%
Permafrost Eruption spell

Calls on the ancient cold lurking within the earth to emerge - violently. The
force of its emergence blasts rock from the ceiling, smashing into the target
with unavoidable force. The cold itself is brief but unbearably bitter,
bypassing armour entirely as it freezes the target and their neighbours.

It will always attempt to blast the largest concentration of foes in sight, and
never explodes next to the caster.
%%%%
Petrify spell

Petrifies a targeted creature and any hostile creatures directly adjacent to
them. If successful, each creature is slowed down briefly until it is
temporarily turned into stone. In this state, they will be unable to act
at all and cannot evade attacks.
%%%%
Petrifying Cloud spell

Exhales calcifying dust, which petrifies anyone affected for longer than a
brief moment.
%%%%
Phantom Mirror spell

Creates a phantom copy of a creature. The copy will be somewhat fragile, but
otherwise almost indistinguishable from the original.
%%%%
Plane Rend spell

Summons some of the greater threats from one of the Pits of Slime, the Elven
Halls, the Vaults, the Crypt, the Tomb of Ancients, or the Realm of Zot; the
specific branch varies with each cast of the spell.
%%%%
Plasma Beam spell

Fires a penetrating beam of plasma at one of the caster's most distant foes.
The ionized beam bypasses half of defenders' armour, and a second beam of fire
follows in its wake.
%%%%
Poison Arrow spell

Fires a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. Even those
resistant to poison will be poisoned by it, and a small portion of its direct
damage bypasses poison resistance.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud spell

Conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gases.
%%%%
Poisonous Vapours spell

Turns the air around a targeted creature toxic, directly inflicting poison on
the target before dispersing.
%%%%
Polar Vortex spell

Turns the air around the caster into a freezing vortex, doing tremendous damage
to everyone caught in it that can only be half-mitigated by resistance to
cold. Those affected will also be swept up into the air and tossed around.
Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it follows the caster. The
vortex is unable to follow the caster through long-distance translocations.
The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas. After the
vortex fades, it cannot be called forth again for a short time.
%%%%
Polymorph spell

Randomly alters the form of a creature. It is especially effective against
shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Porkalator spell

Transforms the target into a pig. The target moves swiftly but cannot cast
spells. The caster's demise will cause the transformation to end.
%%%%
Portal Projectile spell

Allows the caster to teleport fired or thrown missiles directly to their
targets for a short duration, spending an additional small amount of magic for

next to or above lava will be burned.
%%%%
Quicksilver Bolt spell

%%%%

Reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster, making them
easier to dodge. Explosive attacks and otherwise undodgeable ranged attacks are
unaffected.
%%%%
Resonance Strike spell

Calls a surge of power from the earth, striking an enemy within the caster's
sight. The spell cascades through nearby constructs, growing in strength with
each one standing near the target.
%%%%
Rimeblight spell

Afflicts any creature (except the undead) with a magical plague that slowly
freezes them from the inside out. Victims take AC-ignoring cold damage each
turn, and as their disease progresses, shards of crystaline ice may erupt
violently from their flesh, damaging nearby enemies and spreading the
affliction to them.

The disease feeds off the necromantic energies released by its host's suffering,
and as they near death, it may accellerate rapidly, devouring the last
vestigates of their body and leaving nothing behind but a twisted pillar of
stygian ice.
%%%%
Roll spell

Roll into a ball, granting the boulder beetle tremendous speed as well as
double melee damage. The roll may only be performed when at distance from a
foe, and the beetle will always unroll after an attempted roll attack.
%%%%
Sandblast spell

Blasts the nearest enemy with high-velocity rock shards. The spell's damage is
reduced thrice by armour.

afflicted with this condition causes the target to lose access to their magic,
briefly preventing them from casting any further spells.
%%%%

Blasts a cone-shaped area in front of the caster with metallic fragments. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.

burned away for a short time.
%%%%
Seal Doors spell

Imparts seals on nearby doors and stairs, preventing those not allied with
the caster from traversing them.
%%%%
Searing Ray spell

Fires a continuous piercing ray of arcane energy from the caster's hands. So
long as the caster maintains focus upon the spell and supplies it with magical
power (by waiting in place and not taking any other actions), the ray will
follow the caster's target if it should move.
%%%%
Searing Breath spell

Breathes a blast of fire at a targeted creature, leaving a cloud of flames at
the endpoint.
%%%%
Sentinel's Mark spell

Bestows a strong beacon upon a targeted creature. It announces the presence
and location of the marked creature to everyone on the same level.
%%%%
Seracfall spell

Violently collapses a nearby simulacrum into a large mass of ice, which
explodes on impact. The ice affects even cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due
to the strong impact and cutting edges.
%%%%
Shadow Bolt spell

Mimics a penetrating damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a
bolt of shadow.
%%%%
Shadow Creatures spell

Creates replicas of creatures native to the caster's current location, weaving
them from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter.

shadow.
%%%%
Shatter spell

flying and insubstantial creatures, dealing one-third normal damage. It may also
destroy nearby walls, doors, trees, and statues.
%%%%
Sheza's Dance spell

Summons weapons from far and wide - a dagger newly forged, a sword long-rusted
in a moldering tomb, an axe still steaming with the blood of its victim -
animating them and sending them out to attack.
%%%%
Shock spell

Throws a bouncing bolt of electricity. It bypasses half of defenders' armour.
%%%%
Sigil of Binding spell

Creates two sigils nearby. Anyone who passes over them will be bound, able to
act and dodge normally but unable to move away. When the effect wears off,
their movement speed will rebound, giving them temporary swiftness and preventing
subsequent binding effects.

Only one set of sigils can be maintained at a time.
%%%%
Silence spell

Eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes casting
spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the caster's
vicinity. The spell's oppressive, unnatural effect will slightly reduce stealth
for the caster.

Certain monsters (such as demons) have innate magical or special abilities which
will still be usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out.
%%%%
Simulacrum spell

Grips a creature's soul in chains of ice. When it dies, its corpse freezes and
splits, transforming into icy replicas which serve the caster. Simulacra cannot
leave the level they were created on. The number created depends on spell power.
%%%%
Siren Song spell

Sings a haunting song, making nearby victims unwilling to move away from the
singer. Leaving the caster's line of sight will end the effect.

%%%%
Smiting spell

%%%%
Spellforged Servitor spell

Summons an extraplanar elemental and binds it to a durable shell forged from
the caster's own magic. The servitor is capable of unleashing some of the
destructive spells known to its creator, though the strongest and most volatile
of magics cannot be imbued in this fashion. The strength of the servitor
increases with spell power.
%%%%
Spit Acid spell

Spits acid at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Lava spell

Spits lava at a targeted creature. Half of its damage bypasses fire resistance.
%%%%
Spit Poison spell

<Spit Poison ability>
%%%%

living creatures.

Sprint spell

Causes the caster to move across terrain more rapidly for a short duration.
%%%%
Starburst spell

Releases penetrating bolts of fire from the caster in every direction.
%%%%
Static Discharge spell

Releases electrical charges against those next to the caster. These may arc to
other adjacent creatures, or back to the caster, before eventually grounding
out. It deals reduced damage when arcing to the caster, and bypasses any armour
the target may have. Spellpower increases both the damage of each arc and the
maximum number of possible arcs.
%%%%
Steam Ball spell

Throws a ball of hot steam towards a targeted creature.
%%%%
Steam Burst spell

Condenses, then superheats water from the atmosphere into a cloud of hot, opaque
steam centered on the caster. The caster is not immune to the cloud;

for a short time.

If the target is insubstantial, the liquid fire will fail to stick.

for a short time.

If the target is insubstantial, the liquid fire will fail to stick.
%%%%
Still Winds spell

Brings the air into unnatural stillness across a huge area, preventing anything
short of a polar vortex from breaking the calm. The effect takes concentration
to maintain, and only lasts a short time; if the caster is killed, clouds will
begin to form again as normal.
%%%%
Sting spell

Briefly transforms a nearby rock or torch into a long insectoid stinger,
which lashes out at the target. The stinger's impact will always poison a
susceptible target. Even resistant targets have a chance to be poisoned and
immune monsters will be damaged by the physical impact of the stinger.
%%%%
Stoke Flames spell

Adds malice to hellish fires, binding it with flame into a creeping inferno.

%%%%
Strip Willpower spell

Greatly reduces the target's willpower, making them more vulnerable to a

Willpower is of no use against this effect, but resistance to electricity can
sometimes prevent it.
%%%%
Sublimation of Blood spell

Converts some of the caster's blood into magical energy. The process is painful,
dealing 10 damage that cannot be prevented in any way, and the spell cannot be
cast at all with insufficient health to power it. The amount of magic restored
increases with spellpower.
%%%%
Summon Air Elementals spell

Summons one or more air elementals.

plane.

VERY LOUD; OTHER ENEMIES WILL BE MADE AWARE OF THE CASTER'S POSITION.

to safely pass through creatures and harmful terrain, and to displace
creatures at their destination.

%%%%
Wereblood spell

Transforms some of the caster's blood into that of a were-beast, causing them
to occasionally howl uncontrollably. While active, each non-summoned enemy the
